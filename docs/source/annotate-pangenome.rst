Annotate-pangenome workflow
===================================

**Annotate-pangenome** is a gene annotation workflow which produces
representative pan-gene sets from multiple isolate genomes. The 
workflow accounts for the possibility that some isolates may have more
available evidence for annotation (here termed 'reference isolates') than others
('alternative isolates'), and is executed dynamically depending on provided inputs.
